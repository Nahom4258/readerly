# Readerly

Readlery is a web-app that uses machine learning to recommend books to its users(students) based on their academic interests and reading habits.
Readerly would use tags and ratings of books to analyze the student's interests and academic background in order to provide personalized book recommendations.
Readerly will be a Web App that accesses large datasets of books and finds book recommendations based on a personâ€™s previous reads and genres that the user is interested in. Additionally, Readerly will provide methods where users can create and maintain a personalized reading list, track their reading progress, and share their list with others.

# Problem Statement

African students often face difficulties in finding books that are relevant to their academic interests. The limited availability of books in local libraries, high cost of purchasing books, and lack of guidance in selecting appropriate books can be major impediments to their learning and academic success.
Moreover, due to the diversity of cultures and languages across Africa, finding books that cater to their specific needs can be challenging. This leads to a situation where students may miss out on important learning opportunities or struggle to understand the material presented in their courses.
Therefore, there is a pressing need for a book recommender system that can provide personalized book recommendations to African students based on their academic interests and cultural backgrounds. Such a system would help students to find relevant books that are easily accessible and affordable, and that would enhance their learning experience. It would also encourage students to read more, leading to an overall improvement in their academic performance.
